## Introduction
Tiger mosquitos are native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia. This species has spread to many countries in Asia and Europe.

This mosquito species was responsible for the Chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005-2006, that resulted in 266 000 people infected and 248 fatalities. To control the spread and predict the movements of this species of mosquitoes is important for the Humans to prevent or at least try to prevent a repeat of such a plague like in La Réunion.

This project tries to predict the tiger mosquitoes spread considering multiple features for each country (node). The features are not constant during the time, so the spread will move based on the mosquito preferences. At the end and after understanding the movement of this species, a solution will be cutting of migration paths to prevent a plague.
